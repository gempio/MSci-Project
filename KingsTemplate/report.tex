\chapter{Introduction}
	Communication has been a subject of research for a long time now. With the development of computers and robotics a new area was opened regarding communication between humans and robots. With the addition of job automation allowing robots to perform tasks on their own and take instructions, the communication started playing an even bigger part in job distribution. Humans handle the job distribution and robots would perform tasks carried onto them.

    This project focuses on turn-taking communication for energy limited robots with an addition of trying to give some decision power to robots, like proposing potential moves rather than list all of them. It focuses on creating a robot platform with a user interface that will allow testing how single human interaction can improve multi robot collaboration. This will be done by comparing different levels of freedom to robots from no control to complete control over the environment and their choices. This was largely motivated by a paper done by Sklar and Azhar\cite{Elizabeth} in their paper on Argumentation-Based Dialogue Games for Shared Control in Human-Robot Systems.

    The aim of their project was a proposition of human-robot dialogue that would give an outline to how such communication could be implemented. With this a proposition of such communication was given with different layers of communication taken into account that describe the dialogue. In further research using their system, the researchers found that humans trust robots more with their decisions when such dialogue is implemented.

    This leads to the main motivation of the report, which is to develop a real time version of the dialogue system where robots interact with a human team to give even a better picture of how this dialogue can affect decisions made by humans. Such an environment could shed more light in argumentation research where in certain scenarios trusting the robot more in the environment could be of key to maximizing results. Such situations could involve search-and-rescue missions where quick correct decisions need to be made in order to maximize the number of victims saved and argumentation from robots could pose an ideal scenario for when humans give in to the pressure and machines can still do the calculations.

    One last motivating factor for the project is that robotics is a growing field of technology that is getting more accurate every year. Robots are beginning to recognize objects, with recognition that could soon approach human perception and later on go beyond it. In such a situation, having strong research done in human robot communication could pave the way for quick implementations of systems where situations might require a more focused approach. This can range anywhere from search and rescue to self-aware cleaning robots at homes that propose which rooms are the dirtiest by a quick glance of each of them.

    This leads to a conclusion that a framework needs to be developed for real time simulation of robot environments with dialogue plugins being inserted to suit the researchers needs. For this project, a stack of software will be created ranging from back end Robot Operating System simulation software to a Graphical User Interface that tells the user where each robot is and allow commands to be given for specific robots. Such an environment is going to focus on allowing maximum freedom to the researchers to ensure that their dialogue research is only limited by what kind of dialogue system they would like to set up.

    The main challenges with creating such a diverse system is in creating an environment where a variety of dialogues can be ran and tested. To achieve this, a modular system of classes needs to be developed to allow researchers to swap in and out different models of communication they would like to test on their users. It does not however suffice to simply create a dialogue class. To save time in future research, a unified environment has to be created to save time in reinventing a wheel for creating various scenarios to be tested. In this project, an environment based on Sklar and Azharâ€™s treasure hunt game will be implemented and ran along a modular communication class that will be fully editable by the user to ensure various models of communication are allowed. This will pose an additional challenge of creating a platform that holds the simulation software as well as the Graphical User Interface that are both in their essence modular inside the system. For this purpose, Robot Operating System(ROS) has been used to create a simulation platform and the main challenge with this is creating an environment that is also scalable based on the needs of research.

    The next chapters of the report will focus on giving a concrete description of how this system was developed and how researchers can use it to help their work.
