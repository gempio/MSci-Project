\chapter{Conclusion}
In this project, a dialogue-based framework for human robot collaboration was created. With the use of ROS simulation package as well as a complete Java GUI design it is now possible to research how people would respond to environments that closely resemble those running in real life and as such produce a standardized work kit for argumentation-based dialogue research. Developing a solid framework that incorporates various programming platforms proved to be difficult due to time constraints but through careful and systematic approach proved to be possible.

The project was inspired by Sklar and Azhar's\cite{Elizabeth} paper on Argumentation-Based Dialogue Games for Shared Control in Human-Robot Systems and is a direct implementation of the game proposed in the project with a different UI approach. The project was also used as a measure of learning and expanding the field of knowledge with regards to Robotics development and integration development which it succeeded in greatly.
