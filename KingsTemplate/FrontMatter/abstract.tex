Human Robot collaboration is becoming an increasingly studied area of research with technology dependence rising with time.This report focuses on using the ROS environment and various packages to create a system that could potentially speed up the process of researching argumentation-based dialogue for human/robot teams via the use of a treasure hunt game that is also implemented for ease of use. The use of templates has been proposed to allow maximum customizability and create an environment that is modular in its essence and allows to be freely editable by parties that wish to use it.

To maximize the potential of the system a multi robot functionality is developed, thus allowing the users to freely interact with an amount of robots that both the researchers and the users consider appropriate. Care has been given to give a customizable and minimum resource using environment. The results of the project indicate that such environment is fully usable and users don't notice that the way they communicate with the robots is investigated making it a product that allows researchers to comfortably investigate how the dialogue affects the results.
